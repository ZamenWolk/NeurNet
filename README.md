# NeurNet

Quick program with the goal of tinkering with deep learning. The neural network type is based off [this paper](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) on evolving neural neworks, with speciation of genomes to stimulate new behaviors.
The program is not fully functional, but the goal was to try and understand the logic and know how it could be replicated. The central class is Pool, in src/use
