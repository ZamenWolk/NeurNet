# NeurNet

Quick program with the goal of tinkering with deep learning. The neural network type is based off [this paper](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf) on evolving neural neworks, with speciation of genomes to stimulate new behaviors.

The aim is to train a deep neural network to play the 2048 game, that I also coded myself (the original game is available [here](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/)

The program is not fully functional, but the goal was to try and understand the logic and know how it could be replicated. The central class is Pool, in src/use
